There are a variety of methods and techniques, but here are the basics you should remember: ‰Û¬‰Û¬Always keep your grill clean, and before you begin cooking, heat your grill to the appropriate temperature. Coal-cooking will take about 45 minutes of pre-heating. A thick ash on the coals indicates low heat, a light grey ash indicates medium heat and glowing red means high heat. Put three layers of coals on one side and one layer on the other to give you hotter and cooler zones for cooking. ‰Û¬‰Û¬Check your heat zones with your hand - place it palm-down at cooking height over the area of the grill you want to check and see how long you can keep it there. Five seconds is low heat, four seconds is medium heat, three seconds is medium-high heat, and two seconds is high heat. ‰Û¬‰Û¬For direct cooking, place the food right over the flame or coals. Use indirect grilling for more delicate foods. Keep a hot zone and a medium/cooler zone - the former for searing and marking and the latter for cooking the food through. ‰Û¬‰Û¬Use marinades for direct grilling to lock in flavor and moisture. Marinades without sugar can be added throughout cooking. If your marinade contains sugar, add it at the end of cooking so it doesn't burn. ‰Û¬‰Û¬For the perfect grilled rib eye, follow the recipe you see on the next tab. As a few tips, check doneness with a meat thermometer, or with pressure.

Be careful not to over-cook, and consider a skewer if the food is small. ‰Û¬‰Û¬For a whole fish, start with an extremely hot grill and a dry, lightly oiled fish to prevent sticking. Consider stuffing the inside with an aromatic herb blend. Use two spatulas to carefully turn the fish and keep it whole. ‰Û¬‰Û¬Finally, a note on mussels or clams: use a flat plate on the grill if you have one, or use some sheets of foil to capture the juices.

Differing greens (watercress, fennel greens, basil leaves, and others) will provide an interesting counterpoint to the natural sweetness of the beets. ‰Û¬‰Û¬The star of this salad is the carbonated oranges and raspberries by placing them in a canister charged with CO2. By the way - you can use these carbonated fruits in cocktails as well. ‰Û¬‰Û¬Your beets salad and carbonated fruit will top a thick slice of seared goat cheese for a creative combination of flavors, textures and temperatures.","video_length":944,"videoname":"v214","techniques":"roast","difficulty":"moderate","lesson_length":"medium","notes":"","favorite":0,"mastered":0,"course_id":19,"chef_id":11,"iap_id":"com.topchefu.iap.lesson.id211"},{"id":212,"title":"Introduction to Sous Vide","description":"Literally translated from the French, \"sous vide\" means \"under vacuum.\" This way of cooking was pioneered in the 1960s by the airlines as a way to prepare food at high altitudes. ‰Û¬‰Û¬You need a sous vide machine and a vacuum packing machine to make sous vide. Anything can be cooked with this method - veggies, fruits, and virtually any meat, poultry or fish. ‰Û¬‰Û¬For sous vide, you'll generally use a lighter hand with your seasonings. It's a very precise method of cooking, so temperature and time are all very important.","video_length":448,"videoname":"v215","techniques":"technique","difficulty":"moderate","lesson_length":"long","notes":"","favorite":0,"mastered":0,"course_id":20,"chef_id":11,"iap_id":"com.topchefu.iap.lesson.id212"},{"id":213,"title":"Sous Vide Scrambled Eggs","description":"Sous Vide Scrambled Eggs are a unique way to create this classic. All it takes is eggs, white pepper, white truffle oil, heavy cream and salt mixed and placed in a plastic food-safe bag. Set the sous vide machine at 75 degrees C, and massage the eggs at the halfway point to get the right texture. ‰Û¬‰Û¬The sous vide alternative replicates the traditional method of French scrambled eggs - without the trouble of a double-boiler. The result is a silky, smooth scrambled egg.","video_length":352,"videoname":"v216","techniques":"technique","difficulty":"moderate","lesson_length":"long","notes":"","favorite":0,"mastered":0,"course_id":20,"chef_id":11,"iap_id":"com.topchefu.iap.lesson.id213"},{"id":214,"title":"Crab Cakes with Smoked Mayonnaise and Brussels Sprout","description":"This is a re-imagined classic, served up with a lightly smoked mayonnaise. ‰Û¬‰Û¬We use Alaskan King Crab, but any kind of crab is okay - so long as it's fresh. Remember to let your sweated vegetables cool before adding them to the crab. One other hint: be aggressive with the herbs, but show restraint with bread crumbs. You don't want your crab cake to seem like stuffing. ‰Û¬‰Û¬For the accompanying kraut, blanched Brussels sprouts, tart apples, chives, tarragon and parsley combine for a fresh, bright flavor. ‰Û¬‰Û¬Smoking mayonnaise requires a hand smoker. Trap the hickory smoke with a bowl inverted on top of your container of mayonnaise.","video_length":956,"videoname":"v217","techniques":"saute","difficulty":"moderate","lesson_length":"medium","notes":"","favorite":0,"mastered":0,"course_id":20,"chef_id":11,"iap_id":"com.topchefu.iap.lesson.id214"},{"id":215,"title":"Sous Vide - Strip Steaks with Shallots & Watercress","description":"This modern technique begins traditionally enough - by seasoning your steak.

Thus, the steak is started in the sous vide machine but finished by searing in the pan. Just make sure it's nice and dry when you do. ‰Û¬‰Û¬This steak is complemented by a rich red wine sauce and a light watercress salad with blue cheese crumbles.

Charge your canister with nitrous oxide and dispense your foam on the bottom of an upturned glass bowl. It should look somewhat like shaving cream. ‰Û¬‰Û¬For an air, start with a very tall stock pot.

You can also make your sodium alganate bath in advance - up to a week ahead of time if you choose. ‰Û¬‰Û¬The heart of this recipe is the chemical reaction between the alganate and the passion fruit/yogurt mixture.
